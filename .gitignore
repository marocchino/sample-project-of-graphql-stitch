# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/apps/*/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/apps/*/db/*.sqlite3
/apps/*/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/apps/*/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/apps/*/log/*
/apps/*/tmp/*
!/apps/*/log/.keep
!/apps/*/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/apps/*/tmp/pids/*
!/apps/*/tmp/pids/
!/apps/*/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/apps/*/storage/*
!/apps/*/storage/.keep
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/apps/*/config/master.key
